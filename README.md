# About Us 
The overall aim of the [K.G. Jebsen Center for Genetic Epidemiology](https://www.ntnu.edu/huntgenes/k.g.-jebsen-center-for-genetic-epidemiology) is to better understand human health and disease by studying genomic variation in populations. The center primarily works on the translational axis between population-based and laboratory-based research.
